Purpose
=======



Yesterday, the 25 of June 2012, the Macedonian website of Ministry of
Interior (MVR) was defaced by Kosovo Network Security (KNS) group, below
figure. However, after we have noticed and some of the social networking
sites have informed me, I was concern to find out what just have
happened and how did happen, and of course how they have done it. So for
this purpose, I have done some digging into details, about the previous
defacement activities of this very important government site. But before
we continue with more details, let just talk about the situation of
yesterday and what did the authorities take protective measures steps
and actions.



On Monday, 25 June 2012 at 19:38, one friend have updated his status in
one of the social networking sites, as follows: “Хакован". And it made me
extremely intrigue to see what actually have just happened. The below
figure, displays the message spread from the KNS group.




Moreover, what makes the situation even more interesting is that after
the report that the site was defaced the authorities have taken a
measures steps to fix the issue, by either shutting down the server or
restoring the content of the site from the backup. Then after one or two
minutes the site was defaced again. I did not want to lose the time and
the nervous to check every five or ten minutes to see when it will be
back again.



Nevertheless, after 15 hours, or one stressful – hard core night for the
administrators of the site, the usability and functionalities where back
as normal, let just see how long will stay!



Therefore, in the current post the idea is to give and overview, of what
actually is going on when it comes to case of cyber space, cyber
security issues in Macedonia. The structure of this post is introduces
first with the issue, or the problem that actuality made me to write
this post. Followed by the background investigation about the previous
defacement activities on the Ministry of Interior website in Macedonia.
Then with the background investigation about the KNS group, moreover,
with the self pen-testing site with different attacking methodologies.
And finally, closing by with a conclusion and action plan that should be
taken, for hence actions. This post does not only involves the public
sector, but even and the private sector too. Those agencies,
organizations are too much careless and do not take any actions of
securing their IT assets.



Introduction
============



Ministry of Interior in Macedonia site offers different online services.
The site primary idea is to inform the inhabitance about the news,
actions, useful information, public relations, analysis and statistics;
international cooperation and legislation; and finally the services. And
secondly is to give and opportunities to the population scheduling of
service, if their document is issued, etc.



In one short sentence, this site, for some people, it may be very useful
or not. However, I need to empathize that the site is only available in
Macedonian language, nor Albania, nor English version. So, in simple
conclusion this site is only useful for Macedonian speakers, and not for
foreigners, yet still represents one of very important public service,
government agency.



Nevertheless, in the next section we will discuses the previous
defacement and hacking attacks of this site.



Background
==========



The service of this site, or the domain first was registered in 22
October 2003, and unfortunate I do not remember when was first time
available and published. However, in the pass years I have heard many
times that this site was defaced and hacked, but still no actions or
results were shown. Therefore, it made me very interesting to find out,
if this defacement activities where notified and when and how many
where. For this purpose I have use a site service that I know few years
ago, the [Zone-H](https://www.zone-h.org/). Moreover,
[Zone-H](https://www.zone-h.org/) is neither responsible for the reported
computer crimes nor it is directly or indirectly involved with them, it
is just and simple site where collects the cybercrime activities
notified anonymously. The bellow figure provides a details of previous
reported/notified cybercrime activities of MVR site in Macedonia.



In details, total notifications are 4 of which 2 are single IP and 2 are
mass defacements. The first mass defacement was done in 29 July 2009,
when the site use a OS: Windows 2000, then in 2011 it was the
re-defacement and the server operating system is Windows 2008. Followed
by the other massive defacement in this year 2012 in March 18, and same
year, few days before the current attack, 22 of June it was
re-defacement. And the attack, defacement that we write for it was not
notified or reported.



From these data, and schedule, we can come to a conclusion that the site
was defaced just 3 days before the mass defacement attack, so it might
be a simple warning, to taken an action before something goes really
wrong. But most probably, non of those administrators, or authorities
did not taken any serious actions, until the case yesterday appears.



Details
=======



To be able to do an analysis of what actually have happened, we need to
take some actions.



First, we have done a simple web sniffer, to find out what kind of
system, and services the site, server is using. If we request the (http
Request Header](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields)
we will receive an HTTP Response Header with a following data:



```
    Status: HTTP/1.1 200 OKCache-Control: privateContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.0Set-Cookie: ASP.NET_SessionId=3lti3gep3usg4255ggf34tjn; path=/; HttpOnlyX-AspNet-Version: 2.0.50727X-Powered-By: ASP.NETDate: Tue, 26 Jun 2012 08:18:34 GMTConnection: closeContent-Length: 103773
```


The above data, is useful in a sense that provides as an information
about the Server and the ASP.Net Version. Then, if we want to find more
details about the open and close ports and operating system we can use
the [nmap](https://nmap.org/) tool with the following command line:



`nmap -O -v IP-Address`



And the results will be as follows:



```
    PORT STATE SERVICE21/tcp open ftp80/tcp open httpRunning (JUST GUESSING) : Microsoft Windows Vista|2008|7 (89%)
```


From the web sniffing and from the OS version scanning we can assume
that the server is running Microsoft Windows 2008. The current
vulnerabilities and possible exploitations are visible on the [Microsoft
Security
Bulletins](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/)
website. By knowing the vulnerabilities it is very easy task to find out
a way either to commit DoS attack or remote server access. However, in
this post we will not go into details and exploitation descriptions.



Moreover, the KNS, we assume the domain is followed:
(https://kns-team.com](https://kns-team.com/). However, the site is down,
therefore, we will have to understand who is behind this domain
registration. Therefore, we will use the whois database to understand
more, or even we can use another site that have been defaced by this
group to find out more. So there is the list presented the members in
the groups and their archive of notified defaced sites:



-   [rAcKeR-BeSi](https://www.zone-h.org/archive/notifier=cracker-besi)
-   GP
-   [L0wHacker](https://www.zone-h.org/archive/notifier=L0wHacker)
-   sLizer
-   X-r00t
-   SpyHackz



The Facebook fan [page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kosova-Network-Security/176195849098989).
For more info I was short of time to do more digging, but I hope that
someone will.



Action
======



After understanding the details about the MVR site, operating system and
their server services, and information about the KNS, it is time to take
an action of trying to see how vulnerable is MVR site, and to see if
these lads had very difficult time of defacing the content of the site,
or even gaining access to the server-side.



But before, we carry on, I want to stress out that this section is not
to give you an idea how, or knowledge to exploit or use any
vulnerabilities to deface or gain access to the site. We will just
demonstrate you a very simple
[XSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) exploit of MVR
site that we have found a vulnerability, figure below.




It is therefore, from this very simple and easy exploitation of XSS
vulnerability of the MVS site we will be able to run more advance and
complicated shell scripts to gain access and maintain access of the
server. Our initial idea is not to show you how to do it, but to expose
to the audience that actually hence actions is need it. And we hope that
the administrators, developers and the authorities will take an action
of mitigating the risk, and further vulnerabilities of the site.



Conclusion
==========



In Macedonia, cyber space, cyber crime, cyber security, cyber warefare,
cyber terrorism are actually unknown words, terminology. They are not
even specified or added into the Macedonian dictionary, nor in IT
dictionary. However, this is not the first or least defacement, attack
that has happened in Macedonia, nor the first attack that has been done,
implemented by neighbor countries, or someone else. I just don’t
understand why people in this country are so careless about how to
protect their IT assets, and everything else, as well.



Furthermore, it is not an issue that we do not have specialists to
conduct a pen-testing to the sites and services that not only the
government agencies are offering but even the banks and private sectors
as well. We even have a cyber crime unit in Ministry of Interior, and
one of very successful information security research and development
laboratory in Macedonia: [Zero Science
Lab](https://www.zeroscience.mk/en/).



Nevertheless, in final conclusion, I would like to recommend the
authorities to take actions about the above described activities done by
KNS and hope that the security awareness will boost up, and the further
actions will be considered of securing cyber space.
