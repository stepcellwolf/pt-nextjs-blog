Hello, I'm back.

Long time, no chat! So, here's the scoop: I've been using [Pelican Python CMS](https://getpelican.com/) for [years](/blog/pelican-blog) and haven't been able to make more post. You can blame Python upgrades, dependencies, and the GitHub pages tango. The terminal commands became my sidekick, and honestly, I felt like I needed a cheat code.

But you know what they say about change, right? It's inevitable! I took a leap of faith and started [Unicis.Tech](https://www.unicis.tech/), my latest side project. This time, I didn't use [Python](https://www.python.org/); I used [React](https://react.dev/) and Java instead. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is the GitHub [rock star of site generators](https://jamstack.org/generators/). I don't mean to criticize Python, but it's like dancing [slowly](https://content.techgig.com/technology-guide/why-python-is-so-slow/articleshow/95232647.cms), and sometimes you need to move faster and secure.

It wasn't easy to move all my [posts](/blog) to the [Tailwind Next.js theme](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog). Python played its part since 2014, but what about Next.js? It took center stage.

Next.js is great, but how about using GitHub deployments? It was, undoubtedly, a puzzle. A month of coding later, and what did I get? Smooth sailing.

Now that the tech excitement is over, it's time to tell you the truth. I am currently immersed in the [Unicis.Tech](https://www.unicis.tech/) side project rollercoaster, [presenting the triumphs](https://www.unicis.tech/blog/unicis-at-one-year), the missteps, and the novel features. Oh, and did I mention? You can finally leave your thoughts in the comments! I would like to turn this into a tech hangout by pressing the link bellow Load Comments, thanks to [giscus.app](https://giscus.app/).

And here's the surprise: it's a party that cares about privacy first! There are no sneaky analytics here, just [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) doing its low-key things.

Get ready for a techy story, startup sagas, and code chaos. I'm looking forward to sharing stories with everyone.

Cheers,
Predrag
