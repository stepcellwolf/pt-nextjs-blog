PURPOSE
=======



The main goal of laboratory report is to identify three analyses of
malware files from the archive file send by the lecture. The archive
contains 89 malware files. The way how we choice 3 files is by following
algorithm:



1.  Soft them by name
2.  First use last number of your student code + your birthday day
3.  Second, generate random number from (https://www.random.org/) and
    only if it does not match first number use it for choosing the file
4.  Third, use random number generator again and if it does not match
    first or second number use it.



Malware archive can be download from the following [link] [unfortunatly
not available anymore]



*WARNING FILE CONTAINS LIVE VIRUSES*



Task that need to be complete for this laboratory assignment:

- Pick your malware

- Run your malware against 2 of next online analysis tools

- [virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/)

- [comodo](https://camas.comodo.com/)

- [threatexpert](https://www.threatexpert.com/submit.aspx)

- Find additional 2 online analysis tools where to analyse virus.

- Things that should be presented in the laboratory report are:

- Chosen numbers

- General information about malware

- name

- md5

- sha1

- link to analysis result if it is possible

- link to disinfecting instructions – if not possible explanation why it
is not

- Analysis tools – links

- Your opinion about each analysis tool and comparison results.



Firstly, we are going to analyse the chosen files in section Chosen
files and each file with the above required information and detail
analysis results, links to disinfecting instructions, analysis tools
used for this purpose. Secondary, expression about each analysis tool
used and comparison results will be presented in section Analysis. In
addition, in section Appendixes its provides what virtual environment
has been used for this laboratory report. Because we know that if we
open this file in our real machine we will get infected. That is why we
are using an Linux virtual environment.



Furthermore, each file will be analysed with two different tools, in
case to gather more information and solution for disinfecting process.
Finally the conclusion made of all collected data will be concise in
conclusion section.

The above malware file has been reported that is capable to send out
e-mail message with the built in SMTP client engine. Second, it contains
characteristics of Waledac, a worm that spreads by sending an e-mail
containing links to copies of itself. And finally, creates a startup
registry entry.



Links provided, are demonstrating which anti virus software/application
can disinfected the malware infection.



Tools for analysing the malware are:

1. [Netscty – Online Sandbox](https://netscty.com/malware-tool)
2. [Virustotal.com](https://www.virustotal.com/index.html)

From above analysed links we can conclude that the file creates keys, it
changes values in registry, it change only one file, creates process
called sample.exe and adds value to the modules.



The links do not show any way of disinfecting the following malware
file. My personal opinion of the above links is good that they can show
you that this file is malware, but still they do not show you enough
information. Which can help you for further instructions and actions
that should be consider. Not even providing you an information or links
which anti virus software can help you.



Tools for analysing the malware are:



1.  [Comodo Instant Malware Analysis](https://camas.comodo.com/)
2.  [Wepawe](https://wepawet.iseclab.org/)

The malware file, contains characteristics of an identified security
risk. Possible security risk is Backdoor.Agent.AJU [Backdoor.Agent.AJU].
The threat category is network-aware worm and malicious trojan horse.
Its modifying file system, memory and registry. The origin of this
malware indicates possible country, Russian Federation.



From the reports we can conclude that most of the known anti virus
software has hit of this malware infection and it can disinfected.



Tools for analysing the malware are:

1. [Anubis: Analyzing Unknown Binaries](https://anubis.iseclab.org/)
2. [ThreatExpert](https://www.threatexpert.com/)



ANALYSIS
========



The web tool that we have used to analysis three of random chosen files
are listed bellow.



Moreover, we will compare each one of those service, what kind of
information they show, provide and do they supply with disinfected
solution, if so how, and why not.



1.  [Netscty – Online Sandbox](https://netscty.com/malware-tool)
2.  [Virustotal.com](https://www.virustotal.com/index.html)
3.  [Comodo Instant Malware Analysis](https://camas.comodo.com/)
4.  [Wepawe](https://wepawet.iseclab.org/)
5.  [Anubis: Analyzing Unknown Binaries](https://anubis.iseclab.org/)
6.  [ThreatExpert](https://www.threatexpert.com/)



To compare our results from the above list of online analysing tools I
have setup an score from 1 to 5 of each section. Where the highest score
is better solution. With the following attributes:



|Easy to use|Provides enough information|Disinfected information|TOTAL|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|Netscty|4|5|4|
|Virustotal.com|5|4|5|
|Comodo|5|3|2|
|Wepawe|4|1|1|
|Anubis|5|3|1|
|ThreatExpert|5|5|5|



The above table give as an perfect over view, which tool is easy to use,
provides enough information, disinfected information and gain the
highest mark.



CONCLUSION
==========



I would like to generalize that from the above information we see that
each online analysing tool has own means, criteria and different
information to distribute. On the whole, some of them were not that easy
and simple to use, yet they provide as with expectant information and
disinfected solutions. Therefore, our succeeder for this test
is ThreatExpert. But bear in mind that I have not measure and compare
all the online tool-kits for analysing the files, just the ones listed
in the previous section. For furthermore, please refer to the following
article that was publish in 2010 by Lenny Zeltser
[MalwareAnalysisToolkit].



In summary, we found out that the chosen files are malware. Likewise,
can harm our computer in different methods. Yet we got an information
for some, for instance how to disinfected the computer. Therefore, we
made a comparison table to scale the best online analysing tool for
malware. Where total number is 6 tools, and different score rank. The
first one is TheratExpert, secondly is Virustotal.com and the third is
Netscty. Still all of mentioned tools score difference with one point.
