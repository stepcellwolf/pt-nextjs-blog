This year I took a participation on [Internet Society Fundamentals program 2021](https://www.internetsociety.org/chapters/fundamentals-program/2021/), where each participant could sing up in one or more topics. I sign up for several topics through ISOC Serbia Belgrade Chapter. Unfortunately there is no ISOC N. Macedonian chapter.
Together with the ISOC Serbia Belgrade Chapter we decided to go with a webinar and a workshop that will tackle several [Fundamentals program 2021 topics - catalog](https://www.internetsociety.org/chapters/fundamentals-program/2021/catalog/).

The webinar and the workshop was held on 25. June 2021 remotely. For more info please visit the [Internet društvo Srbije, Beogradski ogranak, održao vebinar sa ISOC Fundamentals](https://www.isoc.rs/internet-drustvo-srbije-beogradski-ogranak-odrzao-vebinar-sa-isoc-fundamentals/).

On the webinar I presented the following topics:

1. Basic encryption and why is it important
2. Basic how to secure webserver using open standards
3. How to build security by default and privacy by default infrastructure
4. Building a bridge between N.Macedonia and Serbia privacy and security community networks.
5. Workshop

Please see the [slides](https://www.isoc.rs/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ISOC-Serbia-2021-Fundamentals-Program1.pdf).

One of the outcome is to set up an ISOC Macedonian chapter in near future - ISOC-MKD.
