# Introduction

A computer network, or in other words simply a network, is a collection
of computers and other hardware components interconnected by
communication channels that allow sharing of data, resources and
information [1]. Adopt for both\_ private or public needs, which are
used in everyday tasks to conduct transactions and communications among
individuals, business, government agencies, etc. The network consists of
nodes, which are individual user computers (client terminals), and one
or more servers and/or host computers. Which are linked by communication
systems, some of might be private, for example company, and other which
might be open to public access. Obvious example of a network system that
is open to public access is the Internet, where indeed, many private
networks utilize publicly accessible communications, as well. Nowadays
for instance, company host computers can be accessed by their employees
whether in their offices over a private communications network, or from
their homes, or while there on the road.

It is therefore, network security involves all activities that
individuals, organizations, enterprises and institutions are undertaking
to protect their value and on-going employment of assets and the
integrity and continuity of operations. For that reason this article
will introduce the readers and end users with the history of network
security. Furthermore, with an introduction of effective network
security strategy requires and most common network attacks methods.
Please bear in mind that in fact, this article is not going to discuss
over the depth details, rather than is going to deliver you introductory
knowledge and suggestions for further perusal. And finally, we will
finalize the article within conclusion.

# History

Securing information over a network had its roots in the late 1960s when
networks only existed in the sense of huge mainframes and multiple
networked terminals. Hundreds of thousands and millions of dumb
terminals were connected via hubs and concentrators to the huge central
processing units, spinning tapes, and rotating drives in some distant
air-conditioned, properly humidifier windowless room [2]. Without the
presence of client-server network models, sharing or multi-user,
multi-tasking processors, network security was not yet a real concern.
Network security, however, has evolved over the years due to the
increasing reliance on public networks not to disclose personal,
financial, and other restricted information [3]. Such as, there are
numerous instances Kevin Mitnick [4] and Vladimir Levin [5] cases that
prompted organizations across all industries to re-think the way they
handle information, including its transmission and disclosure. The
popularity of the Internet was one of the most important developments
that prompted an intensified effort in data security [3].

A growing number of people are using their personal computers to gain
access to the resources that the Internet has to offer. From electronic
email, commerce transactions and research interests, the Internet has
taken place as one of the most important development of 20th century.
However, the Internet Protocol (IP) in early stage was not designed to
be secure. There were no approved securities standards build into the
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and IP communication stack, which
allowing it open to potentially malicious users and processes across the
network. Where modern developments have made Internet communication more
secure, yet there are still incidents that gain eminent attention and
alert us to the fact that nothing is completely safe and secure.

Where in early 2000 a different type of attacks were unleashed on
several of the most heavily trafficked site on the Internet, such as,
yahoo.com, cnn.com, amazon.com and many others. Furthermore, in 2007, a
data breach exploiting the widely known weaknesses of the Wired
Equivalent Privacy (WEP) wireless encryption protocol resulted [6].
Indefinitely all those incidents have granted billion of records and
money to end up in the behalf of the thief.

Therefore, these results enforce the reality that computer and network
security has become a quantifiable and justifiable expense for IT
budgets. Organizations that require data integrity and high availability
elicit the skills of system administrators, developers, and engineers to
ensure 24×7 reliability of their systems, services, and information.
Falling victim to malicious users, processes, or coordinated attacks is
a direct threat to the success of the organization, as well as
individual [3].

# Network Security

System and network technology is in fact a key technology for a wide
variety of applications. Security is crucial factor to networks and
applications. Although, network security is a critical requirement in
emerging networks, there is a significant lack of security methods that
can be easily implemented [7].

There is an existing communication gap between the developers of
security technology and developers of networks. When considering network
security, it must be emphasized that the while network is secured.
Moreover, network security does not only concern the security in the
computers at each end of communication sequence. Also when transmitting
data the communication channel should not be vulnerable to attack. A
hacker could target the communication channel, and could obtain the
data, and decrypt it and re-insert a false value. In fact, securing the
network is just as important as securing the computers.

As a result when developing a secure network, the following need to be
considered [8]:

Access – authorized users are provided the means to communicate to and
from a particular network

Confidentiality – Information in the network remains private

Authentication – Ensure the users of the network are who they say they
are

Integrity – Ensure the message has not been modified in transit

Non‐repudiation – Ensure the user does not refute that he used the
network

Moreover, an effective network security plan is developed with the
understanding of security issues, potential attackers and attacking
methods, needed level of security, and factors that make a network
vulnerable to attack. The different attacking methods are followed
throughout this article endeavour.

# Common Network Attacks Methods

Whiteout implemented security measures and controls in place, your
network and data might be subjected to an attack. Some attacks for
instance could be passive, meaning that information is monitored; other
could be active, meaning the information is varying within intent to
destroy or corrupt the data or the network itself.

Likelihood your networks and data are vulnerable to any of the following
types of attacks if you do not have a security plan in place [9]:

- Eavesdropping – Interception of communications by an unauthorized
  party
- Data Modification – Data altering, reading from unauthorized party
- Identity Spoofing (IP Address Spoofing) – IP address to be falsely
  assumed— identity spoofing and the attacker can modify, reroute, or
  delete your data
- Password-Based Attacks – By gaining your access rights to a computer
  and network resources are determined by who you are, that is, your
  user name and your password
- Denial-of-Service Attack – Prevents normal use of your computer or
  network by valid users, and it could be used for sending invalid
  data to application, to flood the computer, block traffic, etc.
- Man-in-the-Middle Attack – Is when someone between you and the
  person with whom you are communicating is actively monitoring,
  capturing, and controlling your communication transparently
- Application-Layer Attack – It targets application servers by
  deliberately causing a fault in a server’s operating system or
  applications and the attacker gaining the ability to bypass normal
  access controls
- Anyhow, this is just a most commonly known network attacks methods,
  and indeed there plenty of more.

# Conclusion

That is why network security is an important field that is increasingly
gaining attention as the Internet usage increases. The security threats
and Internet protocols were analysed to determine the necessary security
technology. However, the current development in network security is not
very impressive and significant.

Therefore, researchers and scholars are rapidly evolving in developing
and investigating the threats further in a future. And with this
information in mind, the process can be formalized and the path becomes
clearer as you delve deeper into the specifics of the security process,
as well.
