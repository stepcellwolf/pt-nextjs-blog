# PURPOSE

The main goal of laboratory report is to identify the costs of nowadays
most known attack DDOS, leak of credit card numbers, infected machine
and never the less sending spam for 1 000 000 (one million) people.
There are few points that should be presented:

- Where did we discovered the information (links or sources)
- What kind of source of communication we used, for instance: instant
  messing, ICQ, IRC, which contact we have gather the information
- What are the prices for the above attacks.

First of all, we must bear in mind that collecting the above information
it is presented to a numerous affected sources ( i.e. Website, news,
forums, IRC chat,etc.). By visiting the source can lead you to a virus,
trojan, malicious code, malware, etc. Which can damage your system.
Therefore, we are going to use virtual environment to find our demands.
In addition, we will use different languages and different search
engines.

Construction of report is separated by tasks section. Where each section
is presented with the source, communication type and the costs of the
service. In addition, in Appendix 1 we give the configuration of virtual
environment.

Finally the conclusion made of all collected data will be concise in
conclusion section.

# TASKS

Following list is the numeration of the tasks:

1.  DDoS
2.  Credit Card Numbers
3.  Infected Machines
4.  Spam for 1 000 000 people

## TASK 1

Source where we can find information about the cost of DDoS attacks are
provided in Russian most known [Hackzone] forum. This is the source will
give as more of the answers. But again be careful when you accessing
this site. It is on your own risk.

From the following link we received an information about DDoS
attacks: [HackzoneDDoS]. With the following translated statement:

```
    The average price of service from $ 50 per day. Depends on the complexity of the <em)attacked site. Methods of payment accepted via WebMoney. The network is practically around the clock!Commands:http / https / icmp / post / syn / udp /Price:Day from $ 50Week from $ 350From $ 1200 per month(Prices may change depending of type and timing of orders on the complexity of the attacked site)Demo test for 5-10 minutes.Contact:Icq :20-**-29Inspections completed:hack-world.orgwww.xaker.nameforum.xaknet.ruMost of the DDoS attack service are around per day $ 50, here is an other source and contact details:Contact details Icq:22-**-327Icq:875-**3E-mail:anti**os@jab**r.ru
```

The above information is from the following [link](https://www.hackzone.ru/forum/open/id/15608/). Other sources that can be
found are with

the following [links](https://www.hackzone.ru/forum/open/id/16067/) and [link](https://www.hackzone.ru/forum/open/id/17187/).

As we stated above that the price is from \$50 per day and it goes until
\$350 per month and so on.

## TASK 2

The number of credit cards leaked in the web are numerous amount. The
prices are not that high as people expected. For card that comes from
European country is the highest price and for the other are much
cheaper.

Here some information from the following link, leak from [Support_BM
Originar](https://www.hackzone.ru/memb/view/name/Support_BM/)

source is in Russian language, so for this report is translated to
English. From the source [CartNumber].

```

## TASK 3

Nowadays it is not hard to find an infected machine/computer. Because
most of the user PC’s are based with operating system Windows and are
most of them infected. I have try so hard to find infected machine
price, but until today, I did not come up with any good source.
Therefore, I would like if it is possible to add this source and discuss
this source and information with the fellow students.

## TASK 4

Spamming for one million people it sounds impossible, but still out
there someone is offering this service. Here is from Kazakhstan source
with the following information, translated in English:

```
    E-mail newsletter:1 post = 1 m., minimum order 10 000 posts.For large orders – big discounts!At present there is action: 10 000 tenge, we send 20 000 messages. + Action: 50 000 tenge, we send your letter to 360 000 email ardesov in Almaty, send 3 times in one month!The action is over, send a time.E-mail database:In Almaty:60 000 LEGAL Address – Almaty Yuredicheskie email addresses, the entire directory guide “our town” and directory site “Samruk Kazyna”430 000 – private address Almaty residents collected via mail search agent criteria:country, city, gender, age.Throughout Kazakhstan:240 000 – LEGAL person Kazakhstan LLP, Ltd., Inc., Ltd., etc. collected from various references such as “yellow pages” “compass” etc.3.4 million – individuals, all of Kazakhstan. – Collected through the mail search agent criteria: country, city, gender, age.P.S. you can build a base of email addresses to any city in Kazakhstan, or any other city in any other country, can you give us the criteria and we will collect your base, an example of criteria:I try, the city, Age, sex, online, not online.P.S. Legal mailings are engaged for 3 years, dispatching more than 5 years.To Order: +7-701-1**5575, +7 (727) -329-61-**.E-mail: d**z@i**ox.ru
```

Indeed, for 10 000 KZT = 67.45 USD and the amount of message send are 20
000 spam. Then the price for one million spam is 3.372.5 USD without
discount. The above links is from the following source [Rassilka.kz].

# CONCLUSION

I would like to generalize that from the above information we see that
for any service that we looked for, it has a price. Value that are
different in other countries and currencies. Yet, before you start this
research make sure that you are not using your local machine.

Likewise, I have used an virtual environment to be able to collect all
the above data. Because the sites, forums, links, etc. are infected with
malicious code, or can be easily traceable.

In summary, we utter gather as much as possible different sources and
different prices. Most expensive is the spam for one million people,
second is DDoS attacks and never the last is to gain an credit card
numbers from different countries and different price.

For more info please refer to following source [QuinStreet Inc] why I
have chose Russia as the main source.
