I increased my outdoor running during the COVID-19 session. Not that I didn't do it before, but I wasn't doing it as frequently, especially in terrible weather. I began running when Corona, the gruesome pandemic, struck us all and shut down the gym. 
Running has become an addiction for me, so I continue to run and dedicate myself to yearly objectives and challenges. 
Additionally, I began using the proverb more frequently, "Running is my drag, cooking is my yoga."

Here are my annual goals from the previous year and the medals I earned.

# Life style changes

I've given up wearing deodorant and smoking for good during the past two years. I feel more healthier and more energised now. Where you can infer it from the aforementioned annual outcomes. 
I've decided to make it one of my goals for 2023 to write more and read more. Monthly minimum of 1 blog post on my personal page, on subjects like cuisine, cybersecurity, data privacy, and many other topics. Stay tuned!
