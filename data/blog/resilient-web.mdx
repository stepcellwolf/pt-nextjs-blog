PURPOSE & SCENARIO
==================



The objective of this laboratory test, scenario is to make explore
alternative “clever” solutions (as opposed to making the site more
resilient by optimizing it) to protect your site against attacks.
Moreover, DDoS [1] attacks, malicious code, etc.



Therefore, we need to develop countermeasures for the **working**
attacks simulated with a standard DoS attack from a single IP address
(performed with AB [2] or Jmeter). Limitations for this scenarios is
highlighted:



-   No additional hardware can be used
-   The wordpress installation can not be optimized: no caching plugins,
    no reverse-proxy (varnish, squid etc)
-   No reactive measures that automatically block incoming traffic: the
    site must respond to at least some of the requests coming from the
    attacker at all times
-   The countermeasures must not have negative effects on “normal usage
    pattern”. Normal usage pattern is defined as:
    -   Bursts of 10 connections per IP address in 1 second
    -   Page load times not over 10 seconds

    
    
-   Normal usage must be possible from the same IP address that the
    attack originated from after a 20 second delay maximum.



In addition, we have to make much of the rules for the scenario. Rules
as follow: Fresh installation of the latest version of Ubuntu Server and
the most recent WordPress as of 20.10.2011. First priority: No normal
usage pattern connections can be dropped! Second priority: service speed
of normal connections. Defined by number of connections / second (easy
to measure). Third priority: How fast after the attack is stopped, the
site can be accessed from the attacking IP again.



Each test and measured results will be exposed in to Test section.
Whereas, the process of installation of clever solution and attacking
scripts will be provided in to Appendixes section.



Finally, the measurement results will be compared with the first state
without attack and any security solutions applied. Alternatively,
providing measurement results with one solution and attack will help us
to identify the most beneficial security solution. Therefore, in
Conclusion section comparison results will be highlighted.



TESTS
=====



Because of requirements of our scenario we need to display the results
before security solution is applied and attacker performance. For this
purpose we are going to use an AB script to display the response time of
the server:



`ab -t 10 -n 10 -c 10 https://192.168.56.102/wordpress/`



The above script provides detail information, yet only important is
Request per second. Thus, with an fresh installation and without any
security solution, it provided with result of 3.95 [\#/sec]. With other
word, 3.95 number of request per second. After applying different
security solution and performing an attack to the server, results will
be divers.



In addition, test were done by two different virtual environment
machines. One is for testing results and the other one is to perform
attack with the following script:



`ab -n 100 -c 10 https://192.168.56.102/wordpress/`



TEST 1
------



First test is to install libapache2-mod-evasive
[libapache2-mod-evasive]. Where, mod\_evasive is an evasive maneuvers
module for Apache is to provide some protection in the event of an HTTP
DoS or DDoS attack or brute force attack. It is also designed to be a
detection tool, and can be easily configured to talk to ipchains,
firewalls, routers, and etcetera.



The process of installation and configuration refer to the Appendix 1.



After completed the installation and configuration process it is time to
test the security solution and to highlight the results. Before
performing the attack the results were somehow, lower then, before
installing the mod-evasive, 2.06 number request per second. When we
start the attack and in same time analysis the server responded with
timeout. The conclusion is that mod-evasive it is not enough solution.



TEST 2
------



From previous test we can see that the solution was not enough clever
for our needs. The server somehow was dead. However, we are going to
install now `mod_security` module for apache, with side of previous
test. For more detail information of installation process and
configuration refer to Appendix 2 or to the following source
[mod\_security].



CONCLUSION
==========



There are three points that we should consider and to see which proposal
was more accurate and it did the job that was required in the scenario.



In conclusion, the above proposals are nice and good example to have an
view of how and with what tools we should perform script kiddie
techniques. How to shutdown access to a server. On the whole, it show as
how to use tools and methods of measuring the bandwidth of network and
how to limit the transfer in comfortable way.



APPENDIXES
==========



Appendix 1 is connected with the Method 1, which highlighted points are
illustration on what information we should check, to clarify that the
virtual environment has limitation of the network interface. Where
Appendix 2 is for installation process of Ubuntu Server 10.04 LTS and
wordpress, mysql installation.



APPENDIX 1
----------



Installation process:

`sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-evasive`

Configuration process is followed and gather from the following source
[Evasive Module], for addition proposal please refer to[Blacklist]:



```
sudo mkdir /var/log/apache2/mod_evasivesudo chown www-data /var/log/apache2/mod_evasive
```



Afterwards, create its configuration file with a default content, with
the following command:



```
sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf IfModule mod_evasive20.c;DOSHashTableSize 3097DOSPageCount 2DOSSiteCount 50DOSPageInterval 1DOSSiteInterval 1DOSBlockingPeriod 10DOSLogDir /var/log/apache2/mod_evasiveDOSEmailNotify root@localhostDOSWhitelist 127.0.0.1DOSSystemCommand &amp;quot;/sbin/iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -s %s -j DROP/IfModule;
```



The above changes to take effect please restart the apache service by:



`sudo service apache2 restart`



You can test whether it works using a script included in the deb
package:



`perl /usr/share/doc/libapache2-mod-evasive/examples/test.pl`
