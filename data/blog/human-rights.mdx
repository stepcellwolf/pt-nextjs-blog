The usage of Internet in the past few years is drastically increasing.
In details, [1, 2] each year number of users using Internet per 100
inhabitants is increasing for near 10 percent. In the other hand, people
that are not using the Internet is correspondingly dropping. Along the
line, the access to Internet, i.e. cyberspace has become a vital step in
everyday life. We connect to Internet through various of devices. In
view of this, we expose data, along with hatred feelings about other
rights. Therefore, cyberspace has a vital impact in human rights,
privacy and right to freedom of speech. For this reason, in this essay
we will discuss and provide the guidance to the protection of data in
cyber space under certain conditions. And subsequently, we will
highlight the pros and cons.

Moreover, the definition of cyber space is as a global, borderless and
nautral space offering an environment that consists of many participants
with the ability to influence each other. Particularly to Froomkin [3]
is that Internet could increase communication among all citizens. As
well as, it could increase citizens participation in decision making
processes. Likewise could increase the legitimacy of governments and
governance structures. However, opposite view for cyberspace, or in
other words “new romantic” [4] is that is misleading for the development
of a clear vision from a legal prospective. Also, the broader concept of
‘right to access’ it may be limited and interfere with human rights in
cyberspace in the plurality of state and non-state actors. Additionally,
it is clear that the Internet provides unparalleled opportunities for
the promotion and advancement of human rights, most centrally the right
to seek, receive and impart information [5]. As well as, raises a
difficult questions of how to simultaneously protect potential competing
rights.

Obviously without question it is increasingly difficult to define human
rights and responsibilities in cyberspace, noted Mansell [6]. Yet, when
we discuss the human right to importance of security, bear in mind that
always it refers to national and private security. Anyway, one very good
example and discussion about the freedom and security in cyberspace was
in May on Stockholm Internet Forum 2013 [7], where I was personally
presented as participant. Particularly, we discussed the relationship
between freedom and security in cyberspace, where the panelists gave
their opinions emphasizing the need to keep the Internet free to make
sure that it continues to be an enabler for economic growth, freedom of
speech and the access to information. On the contrary, others emphasized
the need to fight crime on the Internet by implementing existing laws
and not necessarily by introducing new legislation contradictory to
already laid down principles and norms. Turning to security, they
underline the need to define security of what for whom. Explicitly, some
of the participants do not feel safe on the Internet, and for that,
there is need for law enforcement to improve their capabilities to fight
crimes against individuals committed online. However, these measures
should not limit the freedom of expression or basic human rights.

In conclusion, we have presented above different points of view
regarding the human rights coupled within the protection of data in
cyberspace. And with this, we can summarize that actually it is not an
easy task to give a guidance for human right to the protection of data
in cyberspace. Especially that this issue has been discussed in past few
years, without any resolution and so forth. Nevertheless, we have to
keep in mind that by pursuing security coupled with freedom always leads
to awkward risk.
