INTRODUCTION
============



The main goal of laboratory report is to identify possible infection of
two Windows 7 virtual machine. Virtual machines presented by the
lecture:



-   Win 1
-   Win 2



The assignment is following:



-   Find out what is infecting the machine win1
-   Understand which way is the current malware dangerous to “your
    organisation”
-   If possible, do clean win1
-   Is win2 clean or it has problems, too?
-   If needed, do clean win2



Additionally, deliverable questions should be visible:



-   Summary – Your thoughts about the exercise. Please provide a short
-   Malware that infects machines
-   Md5 hash – if it possible and if not, please explain, why.
-   Sha256 has -if it possible and if not, then please explain, why.
-   A description – in which way that malware is a threat to “You
    organization”
-   Tools You used to find the infection(s)
-   Tools You used to clean machine(s)
-   Where You found hints and how exactly You did it (you need to show
    Your thought and communication process – please write a summary of
    it.)
-   How would you evaluate your partner.



Moreover, we have to consider the malware analysis report reminders,
please refer to [1] or [2].



Furthermore, each virtual machine will be analysed with different tools,
in case to gather more information and solution for disinfecting
process. Structure of the laboratory report is first to present each
virtual machine with details information in section Virtual Machine’s,
Each visualization is examined. Malware and disinfection process are
described. Meanwhile in appendices, we explain what virtual  environment
and tools we have used for this written report.



Finally the conclusion made of all analysis will be concise in summary
section.



VIRTUAL MACHINE’s
=================



In this section each virtual machines are going to be examine in
sub-sections, analysis  and additionally the disinfection solutions,
etc. will be presented. The tools that are used for conducting the
analysis are presented in the Tools section.



Win1

Intense detail information are highlighted bellow and MD5 sum for Win1
virtual box machine:

```


### Analysis



The analysis starts firstly from the observations, then with an
supporting figures, sample of identification, are there any dependencies
and in closer with summary of the analysis. From analysis with a
different tools we came to conclusion that the above virtual image it is
infected with some malicious code. Were certain tools have provides as
an information that there is background accessing to network. However,
this analysis it is not enough so therefore we will do more inside
investigation to come-out with the hosts or network that the malicious
code is trying to access, or an information that is shared.



To be able to identify the behaviour of a network we have used the
Wireshark tool. Bellow are highlighted the steps: Network adapter type:
NAT, logged in as: John Doe, additionally Wireshark run as
Administrator. Upon the testing, the only user application open on WIN1
is Notepad. No additional network activities from log-in user, also no
network activities from user on Host System. Wireshark, it detected
suspicious traffic:



1.  Classification: BAD TCP (according to Wireshark coloring rules),
    Destination: 192.168.0.254 / 8.8.4.4 (Googne Public DNS) with
    Protocol: DNS; Info: Standard query A *mamtumbochka766.ru* /
    Standard query A *followmego12.ru* / Standart query A
    *losokorot7621.ru* / standard query A *hidemyfass87111.ru* /; Reason
    for classification as BAD TCP: Header checksum incorrect, maybe
    caused by “IP checksum offload”, Message: Bad Cheksum, Severity
    level: Error
2.  As a response, WIN1 machine got UDP packet (according to Wireshark
    coloring rules); Protocol: DNS; Info: Standard query response, Sever
    failure.
3.  Additionally, Wireshark detected another round of BAD TCP packets;
    Classification: BAD TCP; Destination: 195.226.218.135; Protocol:
    TCP; Port: 50530; Info: HTTP ACK (before that, WIN1 sent ACK
    message, got SYN ACK and this packet was an ACK). Where during HTTP
    session, WIN1 machine received the following linebased text data:
    *i5eOnJKV57mp5biuqK+0tri0tbW+uK+0qeDr57mp5b29uL6pr7ypurm5vqng6+e5qeU=*;
    Then WIN1 received FIN ACK message from server and send ACK and FIN
    ACK. Session was finished.



The session was repeated once in 3 minutes and received line-based text
data, for all sessions was the same. For illustration please refer to
the following link for more details of pcap life of wireshark:
(https://bit.ly/mDdqAQ).



Additional log files and screen shots are presented bellow during the
analysis with other tools that are listed in the sections of tools.



Illustration 1: TCPView tool, YGLA.ru access to domain



Furthermore, log illustration of hijackThis tool:



```

```


Alternatively, we turn to Process Explorer and Process Monitor from
Sysinternals. In spite of comprehensive information and some suspicious
activities, these tools were unable to show direct link to malware. We
analyzed some suspicious DLLs and .exe files, but all of them appeared
to be legitimate Windows files. Also ee turned to Security Task Manager
by Neuber Software where it discovered file `061afffa0005f9e5.exe` in
`C:\Users\JHONDO~1\LOCALS~1\Temp` folder. Usually malware runs itself or
is hidden in Temp folder. So weird name and location give us enough
reason to think it’s malware. Additional information provided by
Security Task Manager: Company: Not provided; Type: Program. Hidden;
Starts: when Windows starts and Registry: win.ini.



Meanwhile, for advance analysis we have conduct with clean boot which is
explained into the KB article in the following
[link](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135).



Now we run the wireshark analysis network tool, where no more suspicious
network traffic is identified. This means that the malicious code is
running from 3rd party applications and not from Microsoft services or
process.



Likelihood, to be able to identify the malicious code, threads in
virtual machine, we recommend to run an online free virus scanning. Thus
process is done by ESET free online tool scanning, refer to the
following [link](https://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/](/https://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/).



The aim of this step is to help to identify if the threads have been
registered in to the virus signature database. If so, this will be a
useful information and will assist to continue with analysis.

From the above table we can come to the conclusive proof that total sum
number of malicious code running in the virtual machine are 20, with an
9 different definitions of trojan, warms, etc. However, most of them
were located in to the Recycle bin folder. Additionally to the analysing
packets with Wireshark showed that Win1 has some malware, which sent and
received some information over network without knowledge of the
user. Destination IP addresses, names and port numbers were suspicious.



### Disinfection



Indeed, this virtual machine it is infected. Therefore we have to
perform an disinfection process. However, from the above table of the
links it provides an solution and steps that should be followed for
disinfection process. Either with an tool or steps for removing the
malicious code. Also, we can remove the files with some additional tools
that are available for free, for instance Eraser tool. Now that we know
the exact location of each infected file it is much easier and simple to
be able to delete, remove the files from our system. Although we could
use the Eset scanner tool that we have performed previously.
Nevertheless, to be sure and more save way is to do the removing process
manually.



Therefore, recommendation for deleting the malicious code of all time
from virtual machine is eraser tool. You need to configure task and
which folders or files you specify to be removed. After the task was
completed, restart the machine and now the system should be disinfected
and additional we recommend to run the Eset online scanner free tool
one more time, just in case in a meaner of your organization.



Win2
----



Intense detail information are highlighted bellow and MD5 sum for Win2
virtual box machine:



```

```


### Analysis



Despite the fact that Process Monitor, TCPView and other Sysinternals
Suite analysis tools did not help us at all (also Wireshark did not
detect any suspicious network activities), at this point, additionally
registry changes were detected with CaptureBat tool, where the log file
will be presented in figure 2. However by running the ESET online free
scanner tool, it did detect in total three threads to our virtual
machine, logs are presented bellow.



Eset Online Scanner, found 3 threads:



```
    C:\$Recycle.Bin\S-1-5-21-1301155936-2652204530-896827088-1001\$RKV8ZW1.exe Win32/Duqu.A trojanC:\Users\Jane\AppData\Local\Temp\0004fbd1.tmpa variant of Win32/Kryptik.VFI trojanC:\Users\Jane\AppData\Local\Temp\b01dffe3001c4fe2.exe Win32/TrojanDownloader.Agent.QXN trojan
```

Threads are located in to the system directory of Jane user name.
Additionally, there is an other malicious code located into the Recycle
bin as we were able to detect into the previous analysis for Win1
virtual machine. In spite of fact that in previously scenario we had
only a threads located into Recycle Bin, at this virtual environment we
have as an local files. Therefore to be able to identify the above file
and there integrity we have to sum the MD5 and SHA256 algorithms. For
this action we are using an online tool winMd5Sum.



|File name|MD5Sum|SHA256|
|--- |--- |--- |
|C:\\Users\\Jane\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\0004fbd1.tmp|aa17de9a17a58840b8f3b3bd5412daee|6d242dbfec946dcacc90d624defb073cb7d7bcc531c06d566933610fef62f986|
|C:\\Users\\Jane\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\b01dffe3001c4fe2.exe|dc88442c440a5fa5c5fa449a2d0ab1e5|d9a874bf8d9f2f2ca803d38abd677ab51e77008b6cfbab37525dd28df71be107|



For advance analysis, we will run the MD5Sum into the
[virustotal.com](https://virustotal.com/) search to identify the threads.
Indeed, all of the above have been reported previously as a malware.
Meanwhile, to gather better description of the above malicious codes we
will search the definitions in the Eset database and descriptions
provided in the following table.



|Thread name|Description|
|--- |--- |
|Win32/Duqu.A|(https://blog.eset.com/2011/10/28/win32duqu-analysisthe-rpc-edition](https://blog.eset.com/2011/10/28/win32duqu-analysisthe-%20rpc-edition)|

Figure 2 is just a part of the log files that were able to be capture of
the CaptureBAT tool, as we can see form the above that many changes were
effected over the registries. Therefore, we need to run either an
registry system check or as we know the location of the malicious code,
with OllyDbg we can run the files and inspect there behaviour and if
they have any additionally affect over the memory dump, etc. presented
in figure 3.



Illustration 3: OllyDbg analysis, memory dump, system dll access, etc.



Nevertheless, because now we have the locations and the threads
description it is next step to disinfected the system, yet it is still a
big thread for the organization, etc.



### Disinfection



As on the previously scenario, we recommend either to use the Eset
online free scanner or to use in more convinced way the Eraser tool, for
removing the malicious code from the machine forever. Furthermore, to
just make sure that the above malicious code is removed, disinfected
from our system still recommendations is to run the Eset tool for a
second time, for double check the system.



All the above files and threads could be a very harmful for the
organization and for everyday production work. Therefore, advance
analysis of the system it is always in hands to help us to protect our
data, internet access, etc. of being leaked.

SUMMARY
=======



Nowadays malicious codes, infection of the system is one of the highest
vector of production work everyday of the organizations. Therefore,
different approaches, advance analysis, troubleshooting, etc. has to be
applicable and stated in every organization.



Leaking of data, information, access of network (internal and external)
can be very harmful for organization and even the home usage of
computers. Therefore, this laboratory report main aim is to provide the
reader to be able to conduct advance analysis of system and their
disinfection.



From the two scenarios, virtual machine environments we came to final
consistent conclusion that both of them are infected. Yet different
threads were able to be found in the systems. However analysis is done
by the short time of period. In each scenario in report provides an
solutions how and what kind of actions should be considered for
future disinfection of the system. Moreover, in next lines we are
stating the summary of each infected machine.



Firstly, Win1 was infected with identified 20 threads, with other words
in total of 9 different definitions of trojan, malware, warms code. The
definition of the threads were advance, where from the links provided in
the table above, is stated that the few of them were playing very smart.
By smart, we mean, that if they have noticed that wireshark, tcpviewer
or other tools were running, the malicious code stops responding, so it
was able to cover his identity, information leaks, etc. In addition, the
malicious codes were located in to the Recycle bin folder, where we were
not able to identify there MD5 sum or SHA256. If we want it to proceed
in this step, we had to restore them from the bin folder and then
identify them. Advance we identify the user that has spread the
malicious code, user name: John Doe. Nevertheless, disinfecting process
helped us to remove the code from the system and just in case we have
run in second time the Eset online scanner tool.



Secondly, Win2 was indeed infected too. In spite of the scenario one,
this was less infected. The total sum of the threads were 3. Each of
them were supply by the administrator user account: Jane Doe. The
location of the malicious code is located into the temp folders and one
in a recycle bin directory. From the definitions links from the above
table we can stated that they have try to attempt over the network to
leak informations, registry changes and additional files are added to
the system. However, all of them were harmful for our environment and
therefore and disinfection steps were necessary. Additionally, the
location of the files were accessible therefore we provide an addition
MD5sum and SHA256 for each file, were it help us to identify them in
[virustotal.com](https://virustotal.com/).



Finally, the both virtual box were infected with different malicious
code. Advance disinfection procedures were necessary to troubleshoot and
find the solution to make the hence system for being able to use it in
production. However, the threads were able to share, leak information
and data, in advance were able to change the registry and even the
system files. Therefore, we do recommend advance furthermore actions to
be considered. Meanwhile, the list of the tools that is provided by this
report will help the hence users and analysers to be able to identify
the threads in a system and to perform an disinfection. Additional the
tutorials, stepwise solutions were provided as a reference where can
guide for more advance troubleshooting.



Closing, as there are many different ways, tools, process for analysing
the malicious code behaviours in system this laboratory report is
supplying the reader with advance and stepwise solution for identifying
the infection of the system. The above procedure can be applied into
real time, everyday working machine.



WORKLOAD
========



We analysed both Win1 and Win2 on our computers. Virtualization
environment for both host systems were the same. Each of us analyzed
Win1 and Win2. First we analyzed Win1 and then Win2. So the group
analyzed each of Virtual Machines (Win1 and Win2) two times.



In such way we cross-referenced the analysis results and got more
reliable information about the system and its infection.
