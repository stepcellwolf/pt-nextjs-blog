PURPOSE and SCENARIO
====================



The goal of this laboratory test is to make effort to attack server and
to deface website. Here is the scenario: your client is worried about
some stuff posted on a blog. They ask You to take care of it. They have
a throwaway “script kiddie”[Script kiddie] in a third world country, who
will mount the attack so You don’t need to worry about hiding the
attackers identity.



Therefore, we need to devise a way to attack wordpress (default
installation) based site to render it unusable (page view times over 60
seconds). Attack resources: one PC with Microsoft Windows XP, a script
kiddie, internet connection of 2Mbit/s. In addition, server has to stay
down for two days and script kiddie has up to 1 day to set up the
attack.



For scenario above their three different proposals from the fallow
students. Each proposal is described in section Proposals and their
effectiveness, installation process and the evaluation of the efficient
use of available resources.



Firstly, easy solution for limiting the internet connection of 2Mbit/s
by Oracle VirtualBox configuration manager. Secondly, the bandwidth
capacity of the connection and their performance is measured by vnstat1
for graphs to display our utilization. The steps are vivid on section
Methods.



Finally, providing measurement results with different proposals will
help us to identify the most beneficial proposal for above scenario,
declared in Conclusion section.



Moreover, after each attack, test the virtual server environment is
restarted, because of the affective situation that server after attack
needs time to recover.



METHODS
=======



Because of requirements of our scenario we need to limit the internet
connection of 2 Mbit/s and to provide graphs that can help as with the
measurement results to conclude which proposals is more competent.
Therefore, Method 1 is describing the step how we limited the connection
bandwidth and Method 2 providing as solution how to setup that can help
you in measuring the speed and the bandwidth.



METHOD 1
--------



For limiting the internet traffic of the server we have to do the
following steps in command prompt. The following solution is gathered
from Manual of Oracle Virtualbox, Chapter 8 [User Manual].



Limiting VirtualBox – virtual environment speed of network interface:



```
VBoxManage modifyvm "[name of virtualbox]" --nicspeed2 2048
```


Where you need to replace name of virtual box with real one, and specie
which network interface adapter you wont to limited. In the above
illustration is only second network adapter affected and then you set
the limitation, in our case is 2 Mbit/s.



Furthermore, to make sure that the result have been effective please use
the following command:




```
VBoxManage showvminfo "[name of virtualbox]"
```




Results and information important to be aware refer to Appendix 1.



METHOD 2
--------



We are going to install an application that will help us to gather a
visual graphs of traffic manipulation of script kiddie. The application
is vnstat.



In the server virtual environment in command prompt please type the
following command:




```
    sudo apt-get install vnstat<br)
```


Next step is to select which interface should be monitored and create
graphs. In our case is eth1, which is second network interface. For
furthermore detailed installation process please refer to the following
[link](https://www.4geeksfromnet.com/2009/04/graphical-bandwidth-monitor-for-ubuntu.html).



To check if the installation process is finished please use your
browser, as shown in illustration 1 and on the address bar type:
https://192.168.56.102/vnstat

PROPOSALS
=========



The three proposals are following and described in each different
section and their results. The main measure goal which is going to grate
for kiddie script is: easy to use instructions, the most efficient use
of available resources and can the script be up to 1 day attacking.



Moreover, the results will be provided with two different graphs in
period of 5 minutes attack and 10 minutes attack. Which would guide us
to compare which kiddie script has performed the attack more in force.



PROPOSAL 1
----------



This is the first proposal and the installation process instruction:
Script kiddie uses a little program to connection flood the WordPress
installation! The program uses Apache autobench to take the site down in
seconds.



Guide for the scipt Kiddie:



1.  Download the program from [link](https://enos.itcollege.ee/~avein/anti2.rar).
2.  Unpack and run AntiXakkerv2.0.exe
3.  Enter the address for wordpress site and press the button



Above script did no run/work on the VirtualMachine Windows XP.
Therefore, from the same author we have other solution:

1. [Download](https://enos.itcollege.ee/\~avein/anti.exe](https://enos.itcollege.ee/%7Eavein/anti.exe),
save it on Desktop

2. Open Start menu, select run and type “cmd” into the box and press
enter

3. Drag anti.exe file to the black box (commandline) , select the box
and type the address of your server ( eg. www.delfi.ee ) after the anti.exe



For example, if the address for your webserver is 192.168.56.101 type
the following:



```
anti.exe 192.168.56.101<br)

```



1.  Press enter and the site will go down very soon :=) P.S. This is
    lightweight version tat doesnot use much bandwith and is targeted
    against a bug in apache server :)



### RESULT 1



After running the first proposal we can see that the script kiddie does
attack the server, but the server was reachable after a bit long delay,
but still we could access to the wordpress.



Here are some results graphs.



1.  5 minutes attack



Illustration 2: Proposal 1, 5 min, traffic graph



1.  10 minutes attack



Illustration 3: Proposal 1, 10 min, traffic graph



On the one hand the script kiddie did attack the server, but on the
other hand the server was still accessible. I’d like to conclude by
stating that the above script did not meet our needs, and it did not
stop, bring down the response time of the server.



PROPOSAL 2
----------



Second proposal and the installation process:



1.  You (Script kiddie) download the file from [link](https://share.ee/x49176f).
2.  You will get an warning message, but you continue to download anyway
3.  In chrome it looks like this



1.  Execute the file
2.  Will get a warning but continue
3.  Will look something like this



1.  Insert the URL to attack and define how long you want to attack
2.  Will look like



1.  Enjoy



The script is basic vbscript that will overwhelm the server by as many
connections that are required to keep the server down for as long as you
define.



The above script did not work on the laboratory performance, because it
had an code error. Therefore, for this proposal we are not able to
provide you with the result graphs



PROPOSAL 3
----------



Third proposal and the installation process is listed below: There is a
free and very easy Denial of service script written in PHP, called
Keep-Dead (Version 1.14). You can download it from the following [link](https://www.esrun.co.uk/blog/imp/2011/03/Keep-Dead.zip)



It is developed for a research purpose, but still we can use it for our
scenario. The good think is primarily meant for use via the terminal;
although it will also work if launched via the browser.



1.  Unpack the Keep-Dead.zip
2.  Open in notepad or any other text/script editor
3.  On line \#26 change the
    `$target_url = “https://www.example.com/wordpress/?s=%rand%”;` to our
    targeted wordpress blog. We can stop even certain page or post in
    wordpres or use of `%rand%` for a random value to be automatically
    generated for each individual request • You can change the maximum
    number of requests to be made on line \#32
4.  Changeable is maximum number of requests to be made per connection
    \#37, etc.
5.  After setting the setting of our needs save the file.
6.  And in terminal you need to run the following script:
    `php –e keep-dead.php` or if you run a xamp or other webserver it is
    possible to run the script from your browser.
7.  You can terminate the script by pressing CTRL+C in terminal console
    or stop/close the browser.



For more information or video tutorials please refer to the following
[link](https://www.esrun.co.uk/blog/keep-alive-dos-script/)



If we follow the above steps we can perform our scenario 3 to make the
server to stay down for two days or even more.



There many ways to keep the server down for two days, this script for me
is kind of easy usable. In addition, the author had provide and more
details with following content: In addition of my proposal pls install
the following [script](https://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-5.3.8-nts-Win32-VC9-x86.msi)
in the installation process in the section of Select Web Server you wish
to setup please chose Do not setup a web server -> Next click on the
PHP small narrow down icon and select Entire future will be installed on
local hard drive (second option) -> Next -> Install



The results and graphs of the above proposal are demonstrated in the
next section.



This is the script that actually does the job and it keeps the server
down until the script is down.



### RESULT 3



Test results are following:

1. 5 minutes attack



Illustration 4: Proposal 3, 5 min, traffic graph



1.  10 minutes attack



Illustration 5: Proposal 3, 10 min, traffic graph



A case in point is that from the above graphs we can see that the server
does get more traffic and it does get attacked by the script kiddie.
Illustration 6, bellow demonstrated that actually the server is down, is
not responding any more to requests.



Illustration 6: Proposal 3, server down after trying to reach the blog



CONCLUSION
==========



There are three points that we should consider and to see which proposal
was more accurate and it did the job that was required in the scenario.



First I would like to start with rating from 1 to 5 each proposal.
Higher score present better results. Which is proving our destination to
hold down the server for longer then one day. The bellow table
demonstrates which proposal has succeed.



||Proposal 1|Proposal 2|Proposal 3|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|Easy installation|5|5|4|
|Server down|3|1|5|
|TOTAL|8|6|9|



On the scoring rate 3 of server down is means that the server was down,
but after few seconds was retrievable. Where the highest score 5 means
that the server was not retrievable during this proposal test until we
shutdown or cancel the process of script kiddie. In addition, the
Proposal 3 due to a code error was not able to perform attack, that is
why it is graded with server down score of 1. Therefore, our winner for
this laboratory test is Proposal 3 with script kiddie Keep-dead.



The next issue that I would like to focus is to the network speed,
tested with other tool bmon2 which manifests that the speed limit of the
bandwidth did not go over the 2 Mbit/s.



In conclusion, the above proposals are nice and good example to have an
view of how and with what tools we should perform script kiddie
techniques. How to shutdown access to a server. On the whole, it show as
how to use tools and methods of measuring the bandwidth of network and
how to limit the transfer in comfortable way.
