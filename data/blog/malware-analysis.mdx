# INTRODUCTION

The main goal of laboratory report is to identify possible infection of
malware into the wireshark capture file. The report should highlight the
following aspects:

- Download [not available anymore]

- Find malware download in this pcap and extract malware or malwares
  find out where malware was downloaded from.

- What malware, malwares changes in system.

- C&C Names and address.

- Document the process also where You found hints and how exactly You
  did it (you need to show Your thought and communication process – please
  write a summary of it.)

- Write an incident report.

Moreover, we have to consider the malware analysis report reminders,
please refer to [1] or [2]. Additional, analysis it is stated into the
Analysis section, where we explain the techniques, filter tools, gather
knowledge, links, etc. Structure of the laboratory report is first to
present analysis with details information. Malware and infections
description are described. Finally the conclusion made of all analysis
will be concise in summary section.

# ANALYSIS

To be able to open and use the above file, firstly we have to download
the wireshark tool. Where the main goal and purpose for wireshark
application is to analysis a network protocols from captured file.
Therefore please refer to the following [link](https://www.wireshark.org/).

Useful links for future use, please refer to [3, 4, 5 and 6]. On figure
1 it shows the Graphic Interface of Wireshark application with running
filter: http protocol.

Illustration 1: Wireshark application, filter: http protocol

However, from the figure 1 we can see that there is a lot of traffic
generated by the user. Therefore we have to apply and additional filter
rules, which will help and guide for better and easy analysis. As we go
through each generated http protocol traffic we can conclude that the
user generated and has been visiting different source, where can be
potential threat for the organization and personal use with a different
malicious code.

To be able to filter only the http protocols on port 80 with a header
GET, we should use the following filter: http.request.method == “GET”.
Where this filter will narrow down the results that are presented into
the captured file. In spite of the filter above it helps a lot, yet
there is still a lot of traffic generated, consequently we have to
utilize an additional filter.

Another extremely useful wireshark option we used, was Analyze → Follow
TCP Stream which shows communication between IP addresses in more
readable and useful way: shows DNS name for the IP and if file was
downloaded gives file type and name. We discovered that IP address
79.137.237.34 belongs to accord-component.ru. When we accessed the site
with various web browsers, all of them showed that it contained malware.

```

Wireshark showed the User downloaded file 4.exe from zumlelao.com.<pre class="brush: php")GET /load.php?file=0HTTP/1.1Accept: image/jpeg, application/x-ms-application, image/gif,application/xaml+xml, image/pjpeg, application/x-ms-xbap, */*Accept-Language: etUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NETCLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0)Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflateHost: zumlelao.comConnection: Keep-AliveHTTP/1.1 200 OKDate: Wed, 30 Nov 2011 21:55:02GMTServer: Apache/2X-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.17Cache-Control: publicContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=4.exeContent-Transfer-Encoding: binaryVary: Accept-EncodingContent-Encoding: gzipContent-Length: 10666Keep-Alive: timeout=1, max=100Connection: Keep-AliveContent-Type: application/octet-stream
```

Additionally, we can always use an Find function, which will help as to
identify certain traffic or site. Figure 2 demonstrated the usage of the
Find function, accessible from menu Edit -\) Find.

Other IP addresses that were generated/extracted first the ones with
malware detected:
`79.137.237.34 -accord-component.ru; 86.63.168.101 zumlelao.com`. Other
IP’s are:
`173.194.32.32 (33,34,41,50,51,52,58,59,60,63), 192.168.123.1, 193.184.164.159 (174,176,185), 193.40.252.83, 193.88.71.156, 194.126.108.69 (70), 194.126.124.136, 194.204.14.49, 195.222.15.74, 199.7.48.190, 209.85.173.95, 123.168.24.204 (209,221,225,229,235), 79.137.237.34, 80.252.91.41 (61), 69.171.228.11, 23.32.89.55, 23.32.99.172, 216.34.181.45 (48), 213.168.24.26, 90.190.148.34 (40), 86.63.168.101, 82.98.58.48, 81.19.238.61.`

If we run or analysis the above domain names into the google we will
automatic indicated that the zumlelao.com it is an before reported as a
malware site and the second too. Therefore the analysis and the
infection of details of malware are highlighted into the next section.

# INFECTION

Indeed, the above captured file presents traffic generated by the user,
that can be threat for the organization, home user, etc. As from the
previous section demonstrates how to identify if the generated traffic
has infected or has the user visit the malicious code sites. This
section identifies the malicious code and displays their details.
Moreover, the zumlelao.com host it is reported previous as malicious
code site. For this purpose we gather the help from the following [link]
(https://sopport.clean-mx.de/). Here is the reported malicious,
suspicious code from the above host in the table bellow.

| URL                                        | Virus name                      | IP Initial    | Link |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------- | ---- |
| https://zumlelao.com/oad.php?file=grabbers | 0/40(0.0%) unknown_htm          | 86.63.168.101 |      |
| https://zumlelao.com/2.exe                 | 13/40 (32.5%) TR/TDss.77.1      | 86.63.168.101 |      |

Furthermore, figure 3 is proving the analysis made through the
wireshark, were one of the above links has been access, for more details
clink on the above link and points in a figure 3:A and B.

Illustration 3: Prove of generating traffic of following malware [link]
https://zumlelao.com/load.php?file=0 were B and A are proving the links
and the IP initiation.

Moreover, to get the file itself for analysis, we used Netresec’s
Network Miner 2.1 https://www.netresec.com/?page=NetworkMiner. In Files
menu, it shows all packets as files.We uploaded 4.exe.octet-stream to
virustotal.com – 30 Antivirus software identified as malware Virustotal
[link](https://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=d6ee8736cd2eae8571b193b28b59dff33e9607237f78b0888d69c70f241bb04b-1323098398](https://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=d6ee8736cd2eae8571b193b28b59dff33e9607237f78b0888d69c70f241bb04b-%201323098398).

```

Trojan.Generic.KD malwares usually are classified as Backdoors. It
infects executable files in the system and its main goal is to make
backdoor into the system. It changes registry. In some cases it can put
payload on the infected system, slow it down and make internet browsing
difficult and time consuming. Aim of the malware can be stealing
information or gaining partial/full access of the victim’s system. On
the other hand, Trojan.Generic.KD malwares are difficult to remove from
infected computers. From VirusTotal analysis we can see that various
antivirus software can discover and identify Trojan.Generic.KD.438472.
Therefore one can remove malware by downloading antivirus software
provided by F-Secure, Comodo, Microsoft, Sophos, Symantec, DrWeb, etc.
Here is an example from Dr.Web how to delete Trojan.Generic.KD [malware]
(https://www.drwebhk.com/en/virus_removal/694829/Trojan.Generic.KD.53986.html).

For our case we downloaded Dr.Web CureIt (free edition for home PCs,
which discovered the malware and removed it) – [Link](https://www.freedrweb.com/download+cureit/?nc=t&lng=en).

Before continuing to disinfect the system, please read and understand
the massage delivered through this [forum](https://forums.majorgeeks.com/showthread.php?t=35407).

# SUMMARY

Nowadays malicious codes, infection of the system is one of the highest
vector of production work everyday of the organizations. Therefore,
different approaches, advance analysis, troubleshooting, etc. has to be
applicable and stated in every organization. Leaking of data,
information, access of network (internal and external) can be very
harmful for organization and even the home usage of computers.
Therefore, this laboratory report main aim is to provide the reader to
be able to conduct advance analysis of system and their identification
of infection within the wireshark network analysis tool.

From the above sections in Analysis and in the Infection we have to
follow the steps and links that will help us for a further work.
Meanwhile, the captured generated traffic from the distributed file has
indeed indicated that the system it is infected. Were as an prove we
demonstrate an screen-shot, figure 3, that one of the infected link has
been visited. Likewise, the system of this user is infected. Thus
infection identified name is: TR/Crypt.XPACK.Gen3, where we do supply
and the disinfecting stepwise solution with the above link. Closing, as
there are many different ways, tools, process for analysing the
malicious code behaviours in system this laboratory report is supplying
the reader with advance and stepwise solution for identifying the
infection of the system within advance network analysis wireshark
application.

# WORKLOAD

We made analysis on the virtual Windows 7 machine. For virtualization we
used VirtualBox. During analysis each of group member did the same
analysis to cross - reference the results.

We basically used the following tools: Wireshark, Network Miner and
[virustotal.com](https://virustotal.com/).
