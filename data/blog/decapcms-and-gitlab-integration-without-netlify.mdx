I'm using a lot of static website generators, such as [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/docs), [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), and many more. To be able to write content directly through a web interface without needing to know how to write Markdown or git commands. I chose DecapCMS as my CMS.

[DecapCMS](https://decapcms.org/) (formerly Netlify CMS) is an open-source content management system for git workflows.
Due to privacy concerns and not wanting to use another authentication service provider, I tried to figure out a way to use only GitLab authentication and be able to edit the content of our Docusaurus website.

Here is how you should [begin](https://decapcms.org/docs/install-decap-cms/).


## GitLab

After installing DecapCMS in your website generator you will need to manage applications that can use GitLab as an OAuth provider, and applications that you've authorized to use your account.
To do this follow the following steps:
1. Click on your profile icon.
2. Click Prefference -> Applications
3. Add new application
4. Name, redirect URL `https://www.unicis.tech/admin/`
5. Disable **Confidential**
6. Select **api** scope
7. Save application
8. Copy the Secret and add it to `static/admin/config.yml`

## DecapCMS configuration

After deployment, visit your website https://domain.tld/admin. Click on Login with GitLab. It will redirect you to grant authorization to Decap CMS. Click on Authorize and you should be able to see your blog post content.
