## A Community Gathering on the Future of Open Source

On February 27, 2025, I had the privilege thanks for the invite from [Filip S. Perišić](https://x.com/flp_perisic) to give a talk at an event organized by [Nemački Kutak](https://nemackikutak.com) with support from [SumUp](https://www.sumup.com/careers/offices/berlin/) in Berlin. The topic? **"Open Source is NOT Dead – What Makes It Such a Popular Business Model?"**

As an open-source advocate, cybersecurity expert, and founder of [Unicis.Tech](https://unicis.tech) and open source Goverance, Risk and Complaince (GRC), I’ve witnessed firsthand how open source continues to evolve and thrive. This talk was a great opportunity to engage with a passionate audience and discuss the business viability of open-source software (FOSS).


## Open Source is More Alive Than Ever

One of the biggest misconceptions about open source is that it’s just free code maintained by volunteers. In reality, **open source [powers over 96% of modern software](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/hubfs/LF%20Research/lfr_censusiii_120424a.pdf?hsLang=en)**—from Linux and Kubernetes to PostgreSQL and AI-driven frameworks. It’s also a massive industry, with companies like Red Hat, GitLab, and HashiCorp proving that open-source businesses can be [billion-dollar enterprises](https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/open-source-services-market-11799#:~:text=How%20much%20is%20the%20Open,forecast%20period%2C%202025%2D2034).

In my talk, I walked through the **evolution of open-source business models**:

- **1990s-2000s:** Open source as "[free software](https://opensource.com/business/14/10/open-source-business-models-part-1)"
- **2010s:** The rise of open-core, SaaS, and managed services
- **2020s:** AI-driven open-source innovation

## How Open Source Businesses Make Money

A key takeaway was that **open source does not mean “no money.”** Here are some of the most successful business models in the space:

### 1. Support & Consulting (Freemium Model)

Red Hat started with free Linux distributions but monetized by offering enterprise support and services. This model led to its **[\$34B acquisition by IBM in 2019](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/28/ibm-to-acquire-red-hat-in-deal-valued-at-34-billion.html)**.

### 2. Open-Core Licensing

GitLab offers a [free version](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/07/05/thoughts-on-open-source/) of its DevOps platform while keeping premium enterprise features behind a paywall. This approach helped it reach an **[\$11B valuation](https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/16/techcrunch-exchange-gitlabs-mega-ipo/)**. This is the business model that we selected a company that I founded [Unicis](https://www.unicis.tech), by proving premium and ultimate entperise features for money, and providing entperise futures for free such as Single Sing-On (SSO) for free, and not being excluded from the [The SSO Wall of Shame](https://sso.tax).

### 3. Cloud & SaaS (Managed Services)

MongoDB, once fully open source, shifted to Server Side Public License [(SSPL)](https://www.mongodb.com/legal/licensing/server-side-public-license) and to a **SaaS-first strategy** with [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas). It now earns **\$1.5B+ in revenue**.

### 4. Marketplace & Ecosystem

Companies like Hugging Face give away their AI models for free but monetize through **enterprise features, training, and cloud APIs**. They were valued at **[\$4.5B in 2023](https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/24/hugging-face-raises-235m-from-investors-including-salesforce-and-nvidia/)**.

## The Role of Community & Developers

Open source thrives because of its **community-driven nature**. Developers contribute to projects because of passion, innovation, and professional growth. At the same time, [companies benefit](https://wpvip.com/how-open-source-software-benefits-businesses/) from:

- Free R&D and bug fixes
- Security audits from the global community
- Freedom from vendor lock-in

Big Tech both **loves and exploits open source**. For example:

- AWS forked Elasticsearch into OpenSearch after its licensing changes
- Google built Chromium as open-source, but Chrome remains proprietary

Good source of FOSS funding and support is the following [repository](https://github.com/nayafia/lemonade-stand).

## The Future of Open Source Businesses

The discussion also touched on the future of open source:

- **AI & Open Source** – Can AI models remain open-source, or will proprietary AI dominate?
- **Decentralized Funding** – Platforms like [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) and [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/) are changing how maintainers get paid.
- **Hybrid Business Models** – More companies will blend open-source licensing with cloud services.

## Open Source is the Future

The open-source ecosystem will continue to grow because it enables **[faster innovation, security, and developer adoption](https://www.alilleybrinker.com/blog/open-source-software-and-corporate-influence/)**. Many of the world’s most influential companies and organizations trust open-source software for **[compliance, transparency, and flexibility](https://bitwarden.com/blog/why-open-source-delivers-transparency-and-security-for-enterprises/)**.

### Want to Contribute?

Open source is **not dying—it’s evolving**. If you want to get involved, here’s how:

1. Contribute to projects on GitHub or GitLab
2. Support open-source maintainers through funding platforms
3. Advocate for open-source adoption in your company

Thank you to **Nemački Kutak, Filip and SumUp** for organizing this fantastic event! Looking forward to future discussions and collaborations in **Berlin, Brussels, Amsterdam, and beyond.**
