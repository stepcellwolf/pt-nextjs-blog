First Macedonian daily newspaper have asked me for interview before the
holidays. The topic was concentrating on security, coupled the national
security and IT security. However, the interview is posted in
[Macedonian language](https://www.novamakedonija.com.mk/NewsDetal.asp?vest=4291475063&id=51&prilog=0&setIzdanie=23162),
but also you could use [English translation](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=mk&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.novamakedonija.com.mk%2FNewsDetal.asp%3Fvest%3D4291475063%26id%3D51%26prilog%3D0%26setIzdanie%3D23162&edit-text=)
with Google translator.
