    date: '2015',
    description: `The following research is part of a post-master’s degree in EURECOM. First, we conduct research about cyber risk with the aim of stating a problem for risk assessment. We then perform large-scale analysis prediction techniques (finite-time singularity models) on a dataset collected by the Verizon Enterprise Risk and Incident Sharing Framework (VERIS). The study was led by Professor Thomas Maillart, a professor at the UC Berkeley School of Information. The research examines how vulnerabilities are distributed within more than 105,000 publicly available security advisories collected from the Open Source Vulnerability Database (OSVDB). Having the dataset, we select the top 10 vendors and perform time scale analysis. We then present the rank order distribution analysis of vulnerabilities attributes, such as: disclosure date, software vendor, classification, and severity.`,
